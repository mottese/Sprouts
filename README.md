Sprouts
=======

Solver for the pencil and paper game Sprouts. See the [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprouts_(game)) for more information on the game. This solver makes a game tree and tries to determine whether or not the first player can force a win. It's possible to start the program with a partially finished game. Runs in a somewhat reasonable amount of time for games with up to 3 starting nodes. You can do bigger games if they are already partially completed.
